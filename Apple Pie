Pie Crust
2.25 cups flour
0.75 cups + 1 Tbsp shortening
0.5 tsp salt
0.33 cups cold water

Combine flour and salt in a bowl and mix together.
Add 2/3 of the shortening and cut in with forks or pastry blender.
Once shortening is cut in roll mix lightly between hands a few times.
Cut in rest of shortening and roll lightly between hands.
Add cold water a Tbsp at a time mixing in with forks until dough starts to clump together.  Careful not to add too much so that the dough gets wet and sticky.
Form a ball with the dough and separate the dough into two equal measures.
Roll one half out on a flat surface until it's large enough to fit in a pie pan.
Reserve the other for the top.

Apple Pie Filling
6 Apples (slightly tart variety)
1 Lemon + zest
0.25 cups Sugar
1 Tbsp Cinnamon
Butter

Peel apples and slice thin.
Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. 
Add the lemon zest and juice from the lemon and mix well.
Add a layer of apple slices to the pie crust in the pie pan and sprinkle some of the sugar mixture over the top.
Repeat with more apples and sugar until done.
Add a few pats of butter to the top of the apples.
Roll out remaining dough and cover the apples.
Pinch edges together to form pie.
